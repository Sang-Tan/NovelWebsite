# STC Novel - Read novel website

## What's STC Novel?

Online content sharing has always been a noteworthy concern, encompassing various forms such as articles, comments, reports, and even stories. However, they all require a platform for writing, publishing, and reading others' narratives. As a result, we undertook the project "Building a Novel Reading and Sharing Application" to establish a foundation where users can discover and publish novels, connecting individuals with shared interests and a passion for storytelling.
